    "\n",
    "A Caesar cipher, or a shift cipher, is one of the simplest encryption techniques. This method is named after Julius Caesar who would use it to send private messages. To encrypt information with a Caesar cipher, each letter in your message or plaintext is replaced by a letter a fixed numbers of positions away in the alphabet to generate your ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I wanted to encrypt the message `ECHO` using a left shift of 3, I would rewrite each character by shifting the entire alphabet left by 3 characters. Using the chart and key below, we can see that `E -> B`, `C -> Z`, `H -> E`, and `O -> L`. So `ECHO` becomes `BZEL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pasted image 20231227102315](https://github.com/gormes-EPIC/FileIO-CSV-DSF/assets/134316348/36015604-5669-475c-a8c6-3d4674da98d4)\n",
    "- Plaintext: Â ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "- Ciphertext: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same cipher to encrypt the plaintext `THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG` as the ciphertext `QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD`. Then decrypt it using our key in the other direction and shifting right by 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as whoever is reading the message knows you have shifted the alphabet left by 3, it is straightforward to decrypt `BZEL` as `ECHO`. But what if you intercepted this message and didn't know the original shift? By exploiting patterns in the English language, we can actually decrypt Caesar ciphers without knowing the original shift.

    "### Your Task\n",

    "One way to break a Caesar cipher is to look at the frequency of the letters. In a typical English text, some letters are much more frequent that others.\n",

    "1. Using [Project Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) download at least one book into your directory. *Hint: Once you navigate to a book, copy the URL of the Plain Text UTF-8 download and user the `wget` command in your terminal.*\n",
    "2. Open your book using Python, count each of the letters, and create a frequency table.\n",
    "3. After you are done, print out the information.\n",
